                    On my spare time I enjoy goint to the drag strip to see how fast I can run the 1/8th mile with my '92 eagle talon. 
                    Currently the car has +500HP to the wheel. 
                    The car is all wheel drive and was built just  to race the drag strip. 
                    There is only one seat thats the driver. 
                    The reason is to have the car be light weight.

                    Riding a bike was the first thing I learned to do besides the other things babies do.... When I turned 8 years old I started BMX freestyle riding. I have competed in many competitions and won. 
                    I would say this is one of my passions. 
                    Unfortunately I had an accident that held me back a bit, and now I just ride for fun. 
                    Learning the hardest tricks was the biggest challenge. 
                    Now the challenge is trying not to get hurt.

                    Playing golf has recently been the thing that I look forward to on the weekends. I recently joined a golf league that plays on Thursday nights. 
                    Golf is very hard sport to learn, because it requires your body to move differently. 
                    What keeps me addicted to golf is when I hit a great shot, the sound the club makes when it hits the ball is amazing. 
                    Sinking a long putt is satisfying.
