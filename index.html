                    After 5 years of working on it, this summer I actually finished my project car (1992 Eagle Talon DSM). 
                    I finally have a damn response when people ask me "when is it gonna drive?". 
                    It took time, but it was a ride and an experience of a lifetime. 
                    It was beyond educational, not just in terms of mechanics, but in terms of learning how not to quit. 
                    This was a big accomplishment!

                    I started working out this year and have been making progress. 
                    I have made the right choice to go through that journey. 
                    Currently at the moment I weigh 230 and the goal is to be at 200 solid muscle by the end of the year. 
                    Staying healthy and fit is so hard.

                    Playing golf has recently been the thing that I look forward to on the weekends. I recently joined a golf league that plays on Thursday nights. 
                    Golf is very hard sport to learn, because it requires your body to move differently. 
                    What keeps me addicted to golf is when I hit a great shot, the sound the club makes when it hits the ball is amazing. 
                    Sinking a long putt is satisfying.
